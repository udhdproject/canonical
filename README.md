# Universal Declaration of Human Duties (UDHD)

> *Love as the creative, guiding and driving force of existence.*

This repository hosts the **canonical text (Version 1.0)** of the **Universal Declaration of Human Duties (UDHD)** and its supporting materials.

The UDHD starts from a simple thesis:

- **Love**, understood as responsible self-gift for the true good of others, is the creative, guiding, and driving force of existence.  
- **Domination**, which reduces others to instruments or objects, is the practical negation of this love.  
- **Duties** arising from love come *before* and *ground* any legitimate claims we call “rights”.

The Declaration proposes a framework of human duties as an alternative and complement to a purely rights-centred language, inviting persons, communities, institutions and technologies to examine themselves under the axis **Love vs Domination**.

The text is offered **anonymously, for the benefit of humanity**.

under the following terms:

### Additional permission: faithful translations

Beyond CC BY-ND 4.0, the licensors expressly permit **faithful translations** of the canonical text into other languages, provided that:

1. The translation seeks to reproduce the meaning of the canonical text as closely as the target language reasonably allows, without altering its structure or substantive content.  
2. The translation clearly indicates that it is a translation of the canonical text, for example:  
   > *“Translation of the Universal Declaration of Human Duties (UDHD), Canonical Text, Version 1.0.”*  
3. The translation carries the **same licence** (CC BY-ND 4.0) and includes an attribution notice equivalent to the original, adapted to the target language.

Translations that meet these conditions are considered **authorised translations** of the canonical text. Substantial alterations in meaning or structure fall **outside** this permission and should be presented as independent works inspired by the UDHD.

### Commentaries, educational use and inspired works

- Commentaries, educational materials, political or philosophical works **inspired by** the UDHD are welcome and encouraged.  
- Such works may quote from the UDHD under normal quotation limits and legal exceptions, and may be licensed under terms chosen by their authors.  
- These inspired works **must not** present themselves as the *Universal Declaration of Human Duties* or as an official/canonical amended version.

Suggested wording:

> *“This document is an independent commentary (or adaptation, or educational summary) based on the Universal Declaration of Human Duties (UDHD), Canonical Text, Version 1.0. It is not an official or canonical version of the UDHD.”*

## Contributing

The spirit of this repository is **service, not ownership**. If you would like to help:

### 1. Faithful translations

If you are fluent in both English (or Spanish) and another language, you can:

1. Create a faithful translation of the canonical text.  
2. Indicate clearly in the document that it is a translation of the canonical text (Version 1.0).  
3. Apply the same licence (CC BY-ND 4.0) and adapted attribution.  
4. Open a pull request adding your file under a suitable folder (e.g. `translations/`) or submit it via an issue for discussion.

Please avoid “improving” the content or structure of the UDHD in translations; those kinds of developments belong in separate commentaries.

### 2. Corrections and issues

If you notice:

- typographical errors,  
- formatting problems,  
- or clear inconsistencies between the canonical English and Spanish versions,

please open an **Issue** describing the problem. Where appropriate, you may also propose a minimal correction via a pull request.

### 3. Commentaries and resources

You are welcome to:

- link to your own commentaries, lesson plans or study guides in the Issues or Discussions,  
- propose additional bibliographic references that dialogue fruitfully with the UDHD.

## About authorship

The UDHD is deliberately presented **without named individual authors**, as a gesture of self-effacement and to emphasise that:

- its value, if any, lies in the truth and fruitfulness of its **axiom**  
  > *Love, understood as responsible self-gift, is the creative, guiding and driving force of existence*,  
  not in the prestige of its writers;
- it is offered “for the benefit of humanity” and is intended to be tested, criticised, refined and applied by many minds and communities over time.

If the UDHD proves helpful, it will live in the way people **freely receive and embody** its logic of love and duty, not merely in this repository.
